### Intellij idea debugger go backward
In IntelliJ IDEA, there isn't a direct way to step back to the previous line of code during debugging. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using the "Drop Frame" feature. Here's how to use it:

1. Set a breakpoint at the line you want to return to.
2. Start debugging your Java application.
3. When the debugger hits a breakpoint and stops, use the Step Over (F8) or Step Into (F7) commands to step through your code.
4. If you want to go back to the line before the current line, click on the "Drop Frame" icon in the debugger toolbar (or press Alt+F8 on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Option+P on macOS). This will revert the stack frame to the previous state, and the debugger will return to the previous line of code.
5. Keep in mind that local variables' values might not be reverted to their previous state. You may need to reinitialize them manually if necessary.

Please note that "Drop Frame" doesn't allow you to step back in time; it merely resets the current stack frame. So it might not work as expected in some cases, for example, if side effects have already occurred (e.g., file operations, network calls, or changes to global state).
