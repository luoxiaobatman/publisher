### 虚拟化
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that can run an operating system (OS) and applications, providing the functionality of a physical computer. Virtual machines are created and managed by virtualization software, which allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical host machine, sharing its resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network.

Virtual machines are isolated from the underlying hardware and from other VMs, which enables better resource utilization, simplified management, and increased flexibility. VMs can be easily created, configured, and destroyed without affecting the host machine or other VMs running on the same host.

Virtual machines are widely used in various scenarios, including:

1. Server consolidation: Running multiple VMs on a single physical server reduces the number of physical servers required, leading to cost savings and improved resource utilization.
2. Testing and development: Developers can create and test software on VMs without affecting the host machine, ensuring a consistent development environment.
3. Application compatibility: VMs can run older versions of an operating system or specific configurations, allowing legacy applications to function without requiring updates.
4. Disaster recovery and backup: VMs can be quickly restored from backups or moved to another host machine in case of hardware failure or maintenance, minimizing downtime.
5. Cloud computing: Cloud providers use virtualization to offer Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), allowing users to deploy and manage VMs on demand, providing flexibility and scalability.
