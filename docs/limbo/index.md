### DND lore
In Dungeons & Dragons, Limbo is one of the Outer Planes of existence in the multiverse. It is a chaotic, ever-changing plane that embodies the concept of pure chaos. The plane is a maelstrom of raw energy, swirling matter, and unpredictable natural forces, all constantly shifting and reforming according to no discernable pattern. Limbo is home to a variety of chaotic creatures and beings, including the anarchic, shape-shifting Slaadi and the enigmatic Githzerai.

Limbo is a highly mutable plane where reality is in a constant state of flux. In Limbo, matter and energy can be shaped and manipulated by the will of those with sufficient mental discipline. This means that powerful spellcasters, psionics users, and creatures native to Limbo can create temporary structures, landscapes, and even pocket realities within the plane, although these creations often collapse or change once the creator's attention is withdrawn.

In addition to its inherent chaos, Limbo is also highly dangerous for travelers due to its unpredictable nature. Random pockets of energy, dangerous elementals, or collapsing structures can pose a significant threat to anyone attempting to navigate the plane. Additionally, the plane's mutable nature makes it difficult to find consistent landmarks or pathways, which can make travel and navigation a challenge.

Overall, Limbo represents the ultimate expression of chaos in the D&D multiverse. It is a plane where anything is possible and nothing is predictable, making it an ideal location for stories and adventures centered around chaos, unpredictability, and the struggle to impose order on a fundamentally chaotic environment.

### Inception movie
[Inception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/)

In the movie "Inception," Limbo is a dream space that exists in the subconscious of individuals who have entered a dream state. It is described as a place where time has no meaning, and one's deepest thoughts and desires can become reality. It is also depicted as a dangerous place where one can become lost or trapped indefinitely, unable to distinguish reality from the dream world. The concept of Limbo is a central theme in the movie, and it plays a significant role in the plot.

### Dante's
Dante's interpretation of Limbo is based on his religious beliefs as a Christian. In his epic poem, "The Divine Comedy," Limbo is depicted as the first circle of Hell, located just beyond the gates of Hell, and is inhabited by the souls of virtuous pagans and unbaptized infants who have not been admitted to Heaven.

According to Dante's theology, salvation requires baptism and acceptance of Christian faith, and those who die without having received baptism or who lived before the time of Christ's arrival on Earth are considered to be outside the realm of Christian salvation. Therefore, these souls cannot enter Heaven but are also not deserving of punishment in Hell.

Instead, Dante places these souls in Limbo, a place of perpetual sadness where they are denied the presence of God but are not subjected to the torments of Hell. The inhabitants of Limbo are not evil or wicked, but their lack of Christian faith makes them ineligible for entry into Paradise.

Dante's depiction of Limbo reflects his belief in the importance of Christian faith and baptism for salvation, and his placement of virtuous pagans and unbaptized infants in this circle of Hell shows his empathy for those who, according to his theology, have not had the opportunity to attain salvation.

### Silence Hill
In the "Silent Hill" video game series, Limbo is a parallel world that exists between the real world and the town of Silent Hill. It is a dark and dangerous place where the laws of physics and reality are distorted, and it is inhabited by nightmarish creatures and manifestations of the characters' fears and guilt.

Limbo is often portrayed as a reflection of the psychological state of the characters who enter it. For example, the protagonist James Sunderland in "Silent Hill 2" enters Limbo, and his personal demons and repressed memories manifest as grotesque monsters that he must confront and defeat in order to progress.

In some games in the series, Limbo is also associated with a character named Alessa Gillespie, who has the power to create the world of Silent Hill and Limbo through her thoughts and emotions.

Overall, Limbo in the "Silent Hill" series is a surreal and frightening realm that serves as a metaphor for the characters' inner turmoil and psychological struggles, and it plays a significant role in the narrative and gameplay of the games.

### Dragon Age
In the Dragon Age series of video games, Limbo is referred to as the "Fade," which is a parallel realm of dreams and magic that exists alongside the physical world. The Fade is a place where mages can enter through dreams or by using magical portals and can manipulate the realm to cast spells, communicate with spirits, and even travel to different locations within the realm.

The Fade is inhabited by spirits and demons that can be both helpful or harmful to the characters who enter it. The spirits can provide knowledge or assistance to the characters, while the demons seek to corrupt or possess them. The realm is often portrayed as unpredictable and unstable, with the laws of reality being mutable and difficult to navigate.

The Fade is also depicted as a reflection of the characters' subconscious and innermost thoughts and desires. For example, in Dragon Age: Origins, the character enters the Fade to confront a demon who is manipulating the character's dreams and desires. In Dragon Age: Inquisition, the character enters the Fade to retrieve an important artifact and must navigate through the realm, encountering spirits and demons that represent the character's fears and doubts.

Overall, Limbo, or the Fade, in the Dragon Age series is a significant and unique aspect of the game's lore, providing a rich and fascinating setting for the game's characters and narrative.

### the TV Show "Lost"

In this Limbo, the characters are given the opportunity to remember their past lives and confront their personal demons before moving on to the afterlife. They are also able to interact with other characters who have died, providing closure and resolution to their relationships.

The concept of Limbo in Lost is presented as a form of purgatory, where the characters are able to find redemption and closure before moving on to the afterlife. It is a place where the characters can resolve their lingering issues and come to terms with their past lives, making it an important part of the show's overall theme of redemption and personal growth.

Overall, Limbo in Lost is a unique and thought-provoking interpretation of the concept, providing an emotional and meaningful conclusion to the show's narrative.
